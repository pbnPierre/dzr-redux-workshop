# Redux Workshop 1

This workshop examines the motivation and principles behind the Redux state management library.

## Getting started

1. [Install the Redux Development Tools extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)
2. Run `npm install`
3. Launch the app with `npm start`

Changes to the JS will not automatically rebuild and reload the page.

## Description

The sample app is a pretend Redux "chatroom" - just a div that displays the text and timestamp for added messages. A button at the bottom lets you
cycle through different colors for the site header.

Each exercise examines some part of the Redux ecosystem.

As each exercise builds upon the last you can, if you want to, stash your changes after each exercise and merge the solution branch before continuing e.g. from master
do `git merge ex1-solution`.
