# Redux Workshop 1

This workshop examines the motivation and principles behind the Redux state management library.

Note that Redux is intended to be used only in particularly situations where state management using pure React becomes
cumbersome. So, in the real world, you would never use Redux in the examples we use for these exercises: they are only
designed to illuminate some of the ideas behind Redux.

## Getting started

1. Run `npm install`
2. Launch the app with `npm start`
3. Launch the tests with `npm test`
4. [Install the Redux Development Tools extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)

## Changing exercise

Modify the import at the top of `src/index.js`.
